# maze-game

A maze game where you answer some easy programming related questions.

This project is for a local club fair, where I'm representing my school's informatics club, and I wrote this maze game with easy questions so that almost anyone can answer (or make a guess)

We got like 40 something people to play, and took some pictures.

- start at the top left and finish at the bottom right
- randomly generated maze and question points
- white points are questions and if you touch them you have to answer them
- enter your name at the end when you finish
- your time spent will be ranked on the leaderboard
- your final time is (time spent - questions answered)
